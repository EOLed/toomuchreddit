# Too Much Reddit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/achan/toomuchreddit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/achan/toomuchreddit) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/achan/toomuchreddit.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/achan/toomuchreddit)

Too Much Reddit (TMR) is aimed at leveraging visitors to fetch data from reddit
and send them back to TMR in order to provide a virtually real-time comments
section delivered to all visitors via WebSockets.

The main use case for TMR will be AMA and game-day/event threads so that users
can see a stream of comments without needing to refresh their browsers.

Until the 1.0 milestone has been reached, this application is not expected to
be functional.

You can browse the application by replacing reddit.com with
toomuchreddit.com/#/ for the following listings:

 - The frontpage (ie. http://toomuchreddit.com)
 - Subreddits (ie. http://toomuchreddit.com/#/r/nba)
 - Comments (ie. http://toomuchreddit.com/#/r/IAmA/comments/1vhjag/bill_murray_here_ok_ill_talk_ill_talk)
