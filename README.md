Too Much Reddit (TMR) is aimed at leveraging visitors to fetch data from reddit
and send them back to TMR in order to provide a virtually real-time comments
section delivered to all visitors via WebSockets.

The main use case for TMR will be AMA and game-day/event threads so that users
can see a stream of comments without needing to refresh their browsers.

Until the 1.0 milestone has been reached, this application is not expected to
be functional.
